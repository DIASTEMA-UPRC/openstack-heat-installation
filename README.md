# OpenStack Heat Installation
## Description
OpenStack is a tool made to assist on creating scalable virtual clouds [[1]](https://github.com/DIASTEMA-UPRC/openstack-heat-installation#references).

Along with OpenStack, various other services have been built by its developers to serve various needs of the users of this tool. One of these services is OpenStack Heat [[2]](https://github.com/DIASTEMA-UPRC/openstack-heat-installation#references). This service helps automate the construction of cloud environments within OpenStack. It therefore gives the ability to create a Virtual Machine on demand. Each of the mentioned services can be used by applications using various REST APIs.
